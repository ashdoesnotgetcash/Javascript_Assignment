    <h1>!Spolier! The story of the Current Black Panther (Shuri...)  üêÜ </h1>
    <h1> *The Black Panther has gone to Necropolis*</h1>

    <h2>Shuri</h2> 
    
    <p>Shuri is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics (Wikipedia), created by Stan Lee and other artists. She has heavily inspired me with her intense intelligence, profound collaboration skills, and her great mechanics. Shuri's intense intelligence portryal in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) shows me what the future could become. Shuri's collaboration skills show how easy it is to truly innovate with others. Shuri's great mechanics and inventions show the possibilites of advancemnet in Technology in society today. With the MCU's proper portrayal of the inspirational "Black Panther," the innovation in technology could be a possibility. </p>

    <p>Shuri's intelligence throughout the Black Panther Movie's have heavily inspired me because of  the things she created. For example, in the start of the newest Black Panther Movie, (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) she is seen to be formulating a cure for her brother (The original Black Panther) before his passing. Her technological skills, in collaboration with the advanced Technology, she has produced, almost allowed her to save her brother from his passing. The technology in Wakanda (This is where the movie takes Place) with the use of "Vibranium" which is a incredibly valuable, but fictional metal that is used for Armor, Weapons, Technology, and a Power source, could happen in the future, considering that we have already evolved to flying cars, or from a desktop computer to a handheld phones. Her suit consists of Black and Gold, hinting the concept of the website. This makes me feel excited, knowing that somewhere in a movie depiction, it is saying something of immense importance, and this movie scene is what it was. In addition, Shuri's substanial collaborative skills have shown me how easy it is to innovate with others. </p>

    <h3>Ironheart *click the button* </h3>
    
    <p>Shuri's collaborative skills show how easy it is to truly innovate with others because of how she achieved it in the movie, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. For example, Riri (Ironheart) is a 15-year-old Chicago native living with her mother and paternal Aunt Sharon after her father's death. Riri attends the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an engineering scholarship. (Yahoo) In the movie, she is seen as a child prodigy who created a machine to find "Vibrainum" outside of "Wakanda;" because it is extremely rare, Shuri travels to MIT and speaks with her after being informed of the danger she was in. Riri, deep into Computer Science, constructed this machine in less than 6 months, which truly means that we as the youth in society sould do the same. Although a movie, the chance of intense intelligence in society today is not impossible. Even after manufacturing her machine, which was then used by the Government, she made a flying suit, which contributed to the ending of the movie. Her suit was colored Red and Gold, hinting the concept of the website, after pressing the button. If Shuri, with her immense collaborative skills, never gathered the ingenious Ironheart, then the movie's plot would be extremely short, and her "being" would be completely oblivious to me. This makes me feel as though there is a chance for the world to really advance into another technological Era, considering that we have already done so. Additionally, Shuri's great mechanics and inventions show the possibilities of advancement of Technology in society today. </p>

    <p>Shuri's great mechanics and inventions show the possibilities of advancement in Technology in society today because she was just 21, doing things that positively impacted her extensive community. (She was the Queen of Wakanda) For example, "We do not rely on the Black Panther." This is a quote from the movie, telling the U.N (United Nations) that "Wakanda" is not reliant on a savior, however, Shuri and Riri's contribution was essential to the winning of the battle at the end of the movie. (There is an Antagonist titled "Namor" in the movie, and the contribution of the new "Black Panther" and "Ironheart" is what won the battle. (With the help of Wakandan soldiers.) Shuri experienced immense pain after continuous death, but her grief and strong-willing personality, allowed her to push through the pain and save her community. (Namor drowned Shuri's mother intentionally with the use of "water bombs," but this did not stop her from almost completly ending him in the end of the movie.) "How does the relate to Ironheart?" In the end, the both have innumerable similaraties, that heavily inspire me. This makes me feel like the cause and effect for both of these characters was flawless, and makes me wonder if Computer Science and Engineering is extremly important in society today. Furthermore, With the MCU's proper portrayal of the inspirational "Black Panther," the innovation in technology could be a possibility.</p>

    <p>With the MCU's proper portrayal of the inspirational "Black Panther," the innovation in technology could be a possibility because of the rapid advancements in society. The world, although sometimes dysfunctional, is always advancing regardless of its defects, and as the world advances, us as humans that roam around it should advance aswell. Technology is a topic that could continuously be spoken about because it never stops advancing, physically, or in an algorithimic perspective. Shuri, Ironheart, and Namor are all fictional characters but the idea of "Holographic Technoology," and suits being extremly powerful is not impossible. Shuri and Riri inspire me with thier intelligence, collaboration skills, and great mechanics. This movie seemed so phenomenal and this essay, should have not only expresses my opinions on each geniuses, but inspire you to watch the movie aswell. (Can be watched on Disney+)  </p>
